# CryptoPalChallenges
My solutions for the Cryptopals challenges, found here: https://cryptopals.com

Set One was initially used as an aid for improving my python skills, set two became a fun place to learn about basic cryptography! 

On the todo list: 
1. Refactoring the code for set one, there are a lot of beginner poor practyices in there
2. Continuing on to set number 3
